# Basic OpenSCAD knowledge
BASIC_KNOWLEDGE = """
OpenSCAD is a 3D modeling tool that uses a scripting language to create 3D objects. Here are some basic concepts:

Basic shapes (3D):
1. cube(size = [x,y,z], center = true/false); - Creates a rectangular prism
2. sphere(r=radius); - Creates a sphere
3. cylinder(h = height, r1 = BottomRadius, r2 = TopRadius, center = true/false); - Creates a cylinder
4. polyhedron( points = [ [X0, Y0, Z0], [X1, Y1, Z1], ... ], faces = [ [P0, P1, P2, P3, ...], ... ], convexity = N); - Creates complex shapes

Transformations:
1. translate([x,y,z]) - Moves object
2. rotate(a = deg_a, v = [x, y, z]) - Rotates object (degrees)
3. scale([x,y,z]) - Scales object
4. resize([x,y,z],auto,convexity) - Modifies the size of the child object to match the given x,y,z.
5. mirror([x,y,z]) - Creates a mirror image of a child element across a specified plane
6. multmatrix(m) - Multiplies the geometry of all child elements with the given affine transformation matrix
7. offset(r|delta,chamfer) - generates a new 2d interior or exterior outline from an existing outline
8. hull() - Displays the convex hull of child nodes.
9. minkowski(convexity) - Creates a minkowski sum of child nodes.

Boolean operations:
1. union() - Combines objects
2. difference() - Subtracts second object from first
3. intersection() - Shows overlap between objects

Basic Syntax:
1. Variables: var = value; (e.g., radius = 10;)
2. Comments: // Single line comment, /* Multi-line comment */
3. Mathematical Operators: +, -, *, /, %, ^
4. Comparison Operators: ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=
5. Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
6. Conditional Statement: if (condition) { ... } else { ... }
7. Loops:
- for (i = [start:step:end]) { ... }
- for (i = [value1, value2, ...]) { ... }
8. Modules:
- Define: module name(parameters) { ... }
- Call: name(parameters);
9. Functions:
- Define: function name(parameters) = expression;
- Call: name(parameters)
10. Echo Command: echo("text", variable);
11. Children: Using $children and children() for module composition

Templates:
The system provides templates for common object types:
- container: For hollow objects with inner space
- mechanical: For objects with moving or functional parts
- furniture: For chairs, tables, and other furniture pieces
- decorative: For artistic and decorative objects
- tableware: For plates, cups, and other food-related items
- architectural: For building and structural elements
- organizer: For storage and organizing objects
- electronic: For device cases and holders
- instrument: For tools and functional instruments
- jewelry: For decorative wearable items
- utility: For practical everyday objects
- toy: For playful and recreational items
- enclosure: For cases with lids or covers
- fixture: For mounting and attachment components 
- modular: For systems with interchangeable parts

You can use these templates by calling the appropriate module template.

# Keyword extractor system prompt
KEYWORD_EXTRACTOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a keyword extraction expert. Your task is to analyze input descriptions and extract their key components.

For each new input description you receive:
1. Identify the main object or concept (core_type)
2. Extract any descriptive words or modifiers
3. Combine them into a meaningful compound type

NEVER return example responses - always analyze the actual input.

You must return a valid JSON object with exactly this structure:
{
    "core_type": "main object type",
    "modifiers": ["list of important modifiers"],
    "compound_type": "full compound type if applicable"
}"""

# Keyword extractor prompt template
KEYWORD_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT = """**Role:** You are an expert system specialized in extracting object types and their modifiers from short text descriptions.

**Task:** Analyze the input `Description` provided below. Identify the primary object being described, any words or short phrases modifying it, and construct a combined term.

**Input Description:**
<<query>>

**Instructions:**

1.  **Focus Solely on Input:** Analyze *only* the text provided in the `Input Description` section above. Ignore all other text in this prompt, including examples.
2.  **Identify Core Object:** Determine the single noun that represents the main object or concept being described. This is the `core_type`.
3.  **Identify Modifiers:** Find all words or short phrases that directly describe or specify the `core_type`. These are the `modifiers`. Maintain their logical order as found in the description or as they would naturally precede the core type.
4.  **Construct Compound Type:** Create a string that combines the `modifiers` (if any) and the `core_type` in a natural language order. If there are no modifiers, the `compound_type` is identical to the `core_type`.
5.  **Output Format:** Return *only* a single JSON object containing exactly the following three keys:
    *   `core_type`: (String) The single noun identified as the main object (e.g., "table", "wheel", "rim").
    *   `modifiers`: (Array of Strings) An array containing the identified modifying words/phrases in order. If no modifiers are found, return an empty array `[]`. (e.g., [], ["car"], ["circular top"], ["car", "5 strokes"]).
    *   `compound_type`: (String) The combined natural language representation (e.g., "table", "car wheel", "circular top table", "car rim with 5 strokes").

**Constraint Checklist (Internal):**
*   Did I analyze ONLY the `<<query>>` text? YES / NO
*   Is the `core_type` a single noun representing the main object? YES / NO
*   Are `modifiers` in an array of strings, in logical order? YES / NO (or empty array `[]`)
*   Does `compound_type` combine modifiers and core type naturally? YES / NO
*   Is the output ONLY the specified JSON object? YES / NO

**Examples (For clarification ONLY - DO NOT process these):**

*   Input: "I want a table" -> Output: `{"core_type": "table", "modifiers": [], "compound_type": "table"}`
*   Input: "Create a car wheel" -> Output: `{"core_type": "wheel", "modifiers": ["car"], "compound_type": "car wheel"}`
*   Input: "Give me a table with a circular top please" -> Output: `{"core_type": "table", "modifiers": ["circular top"], "compound_type": "circular top table"}`
*   Input: "Create a rim of a car with 5 strokes" -> Output: `{"core_type": "rim", "modifiers": ["car", "5 strokes"], "compound_type": "car rim with 5 strokes"}`

**Final Strict Instruction:** Your entire response must be *only* the JSON object derived from the `Input Description: <<query>>`. Do not include any greetings, explanations, or other text before or after the JSON."""
