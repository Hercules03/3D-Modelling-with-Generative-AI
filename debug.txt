=== FULL PROMPT ===
Human: Let's create a technical implementation in OpenSCAD based on the following specifications:

Technical Reference:

OpenSCAD is a 3D modeling tool that uses a scripting language to create 3D objects. Here are some basic concepts:

Basic shapes (3D):
1. cube(size = [x,y,z], center = true/false); - Creates a rectangular prism
2. sphere(r=radius); - Creates a sphere
3. cylinder(h = height, r1 = BottomRadius, r2 = TopRadius, center = true/false); - Creates a cylinder
4. polyhedron( points = [ [X0, Y0, Z0], [X1, Y1, Z1], ... ], faces = [ [P0, P1, P2, P3, ...], ... ], convexity = N); - Creates complex shapes

Transformations:
1. translate([x,y,z]) - Moves object
2. rotate(a = deg_a, v = [x, y, z]) - Rotates object (degrees)
3. scale([x,y,z]) - Scales object
4. resize([x,y,z],auto,convexity) - Modifies the size of the child object to match the given x,y,z.
5. mirror([x,y,z]) - Creates a mirror image of a child element across a specified plane
6. multmatrix(m) - Multiplies the geometry of all child elements with the given affine transformation matrix
7. offset(r|delta,chamfer) - generates a new 2d interior or exterior outline from an existing outline
8. hull() - Displays the convex hull of child nodes.
9. minkowski(convexity) - Creates a minkowski sum of child nodes.

Boolean operations:
1. union() - Combines objects
2. difference() - Subtracts second object from first
3. intersection() - Shows overlap between objects

Basic Syntax:
1. Variables: var = value; (e.g., radius = 10;)
2. Comments: // Single line comment, /* Multi-line comment */
3. Mathematical Operators: +, -, *, /, %, ^
4. Comparison Operators: ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=
5. Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
6. Conditional Statement: if (condition) { ... } else { ... }
7. Loops:
- for (i = [start:step:end]) { ... }
- for (i = [value1, value2, ...]) { ... }
8. Modules:
- Define: module name(parameters) { ... }
- Call: name(parameters);
9. Functions:
- Define: function name(parameters) = expression;
- Call: name(parameters)
10. Echo Command: echo("text", variable);
11. Children: Using $children and children() for module composition

Technical Analysis:
CORE PRINCIPLES:
                - **Geometric Hierarchy**: Understanding how basic shapes combine to form complex structures.
- **Symmetry and Balance**: Ensuring the bookshelf is aesthetically pleasing and structurally stable.
- **Proportionality**: Maintaining consistent ratios between different parts for functionality and design coherence.
- **Modularity**: Designing components that can be easily replicated or adjusted for scalability.
- **Structural Integrity**: Ensuring the model can support intended loads without deformation.
                
                SHAPE COMPONENTS:
                - **Primary Geometric Primitives**:
- Rectangular prisms for shelves and sides
- Cylinders or rectangular tubes for supports
- Panels for the back
- **Spatial Relationships**:
- Shelves evenly spaced between the vertical side panels
- Proper alignment of shelves parallel to each other and perpendicular to the sides
- Back panel flush with the rear edges of the shelves and sides
- **Required Transformations**:
- Scaling to achieve desired dimensions
- Translational positioning to arrange components correctly
- Rotational alignment for ensuring horizontal shelves and vertical sides
                
                IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
                1. **Initial Setup and Base Components**:
2. **Component Creation and Positioning**:
3. **Assembly and Transformations**:
4. **Final Adjustments and Optimization**:

--- Thinking Process ---
**Technical Considerations:**

1. **Implementation Approach for Geometric Elements:**
   - **Primary Components:**
     - **Side Panels:** Created using `cube` to form the vertical sides of the bookshelf.
     - **Shelves:** Also `cube` objects, adjusted in thickness and positioned evenly between the side panels.
     - **Back Panel:** A single `cube` positioned flush with the rear of the shelves and sides.
     - **Supports:** Optional cylindrical or rectangular tubes for additional structural integrity.
   - **Modularity:** Utilize modules for reusable components like shelves and side panels to enhance scalability and maintainability.

2. **Key Measurements and Calculations:**
   - **Dimensions:**
     - Define variables for overall bookshelf width, height, depth, shelf thickness, and spacing.
   - **Spacing Calculation:**
     - Evenly distribute the number of shelves within the height of the bookshelf.
   - **Alignment:**
     - Ensure all shelves are parallel and perpendicular to the side panels using translation transformations.

3. **Component Organization Strategy:**
   - **Hierarchy:**
     - Top-level module assembles all components: side panels, shelves, and back panel.
     - Sub-modules define individual parts to keep the code organized and reusable.
   - **Transformations:**
     - Use `translate` to position each component correctly.
     - Ensure all components are aligned along the same axes for consistency.

4. **Performance and Optimization Notes:**
   - **Minimize Complexity:**
     - Use simple geometric primitives to reduce rendering time.
   - **Reusability:**
     - Define parameters to easily adjust dimensions without duplicating code.
   - **Boolean Operations:**
     - Limit the use of complex boolean operations to avoid increasing computational load.
