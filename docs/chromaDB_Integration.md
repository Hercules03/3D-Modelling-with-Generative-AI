# ChromaDB Integration Enhancements

This document details the enhanced ChromaDB integration in our 3D modeling system, focusing on three major improvements: complexity scoring, component-based filtering, and result ranking.

## 1. Complexity Scoring

The system now includes a sophisticated complexity scoring mechanism that evaluates both code structure and metadata attributes.

### Code-Based Complexity Factors (70% of score)

```python
def _calculate_complexity_score(self, code, metadata):
    # Score ranges from 0-100
    score = 0
    
    # Operations/Functions (max 30 points)
    operations = count_operations(code)  # union, difference, intersection, etc.
    score += min(operations * 2, 30)
    
    # Nesting Levels (max 20 points)
    max_nesting = calculate_nesting(code)
    score += min(max_nesting * 5, 20)
    
    # Variables and Modules (max 20 points)
    vars_and_modules = count_vars_and_modules(code)
    score += min(vars_and_modules * 2, 20)
    
    # Geometric Operations (max 15 points)
    geometric_ops = count_geometric_ops(code)
    score += min(geometric_ops * 3, 15)
```

### Metadata-Based Complexity Factors (30% of score)

- Declared complexity level (+5-15 points)
  - Intricate: +15
  - Complex: +10
  - Moderate: +5

- Printability assessment (+0-10 points)
  - Challenging: +10
  - Requires support: +5

- Support requirements (+0-10 points)
  - Extensive: +10
  - Moderate: +5

## 2. Component-Based Filtering

The system implements a sophisticated component matching system that analyzes both the query and existing examples.

### Component Analysis

```python
def _analyze_components(self, code):
    components = []
    
    # Extract components by type:
    1. Modules (reusable components)
    2. Geometric primitives (sphere, cube, cylinder, etc.)
    3. Transformations (translate, rotate, scale, etc.)
    4. Boolean operations (union, difference, intersection)
```

### Component Matching Process

1. Query Analysis:
   - Extracts required components from user query
   - Analyzes step-back technical requirements
   - Identifies core geometric primitives needed

2. Example Analysis:
   - Parses OpenSCAD code for component usage
   - Identifies reusable modules
   - Maps transformations and operations

3. Matching Score Calculation:
   ```python
   matching_components = 0
   total_components = len(query_components)
   for qc in query_components:
       if component_exists_in_example(qc, example_components):
           matching_components += 1
   score = matching_components / total_components
   ```

## 3. Result Ranking and Filtering

The system employs a multi-factor ranking system that combines various scores to determine the most relevant examples.

### Scoring Weights

```python
final_score = (
    similarity * 0.25 +           # Base similarity (25%)
    step_back_score * 0.25 +      # Step-back analysis matching (25%)
    component_match * 0.25 +      # Component matching (25%)
    metadata_match * 0.15 +       # Metadata matching (15%)
    (complexity_score/100) * 0.1  # Complexity score (10%)
)
```

### Step-Back Analysis Integration

The system now incorporates step-back analysis in the search process:

1. Structured Parsing:
   - Core Principles
   - Shape Components
   - Implementation Steps

2. Similarity Calculation:
   ```python
   for section in ['principles', 'abstractions', 'approach']:
       query_items = query_analysis[section]
       example_items = example_analysis[section]
       
       # Calculate word overlap
       overlap = len(query_words & example_words) / len(query_words | example_words)
       if overlap > 0.3:  # 30% threshold
           matching_items += overlap
   ```

### Filtering Process

1. Initial Query:
   - Enriched with step-back analysis
   - Enhanced with technical requirements
   - Component requirements extracted

2. Result Processing:
   - Calculate all scoring factors
   - Apply weighted scoring
   - Filter by similarity threshold
   - Sort by final score

3. Final Selection:
   ```python
   filtered_results = [
       result for result in ranked_results[:max_examples]
       if result['scores']['final'] >= similarity_threshold
   ]
   ```

## Implementation Impact

These enhancements have significantly improved the system's ability to:

1. **Better Match Complexity**: More accurately match user requirements with examples of appropriate complexity.

2. **Component Awareness**: Ensure returned examples contain the necessary geometric primitives and operations.

3. **Improved Relevance**: Better ranking of results based on multiple factors, not just text similarity.

4. **Technical Understanding**: Integration of step-back analysis for better technical matching.

## Usage Example

```python
# Get relevant examples with enhanced matching
results = knowledge_base.get_relevant_examples(
    query="I want a complex coffee mug with a decorative handle",
    max_examples=2,
    similarity_threshold=0.7
)

# Results include detailed scoring breakdown
for result in results:
    print(f"Final Score: {result['scores']['final']}")
    print(f"Component Match: {result['scores']['component_match']}")
    print(f"Complexity Score: {result['scores']['complexity']}")
    print(f"Step-back Match: {result['scores']['step_back']}")
```
