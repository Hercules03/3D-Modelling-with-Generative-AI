I did this by drawing lines and curves, and applying specified dimensions and constraints as required. You do this so that all of your lines are dimensioned with respect to each other and the model becomes fully defined.\u2022 Once I was finished with the side profile, I created a 3D shape by extruding the curve profile sideways. \u2022 Now that we have the general shape, I used a 3D [...] Hello! Today we will be designing, modelling and 3D printing a custom cell phone stand from scratch!For one of my first year university courses, we were challenged to design a cell phone stand on paper and then to solid model it using Solidworks. Finally, it would be 3D printed for us to keep. This Instructable documents each step of the design process - from defining constraints and criteria, to drawing initial designs, to solid modelling, and finally 3D printing. [...] Step 3: Introduction to Solid Modelling\n---\n\nTitle: Tensegrity structure phone stand by winfordew - Thingiverse\nContent: Inspired by the commonly seen tensegrity structure, this phone stand is designed. This stand included two parts which are the base part and the upper part.\n---\n\nTitle: Design a Cell Phone Stand | Scientific American\nContent: Specify the requirements for your phone stand. These will depend on how you plan to use the stand. For example, do you need it to work for phones of different sizes or just one phone? Do you want the angle of the phone to be adjustable? Do you need to make sure certain buttons or ports on the phone remain accessible? Do you need to be able to type or push buttons on the screen without knocking it over? [...] IntroductionYou\u2019ve probably seen plenty of smartphone holders or stands. You might use one to prop up a tablet to watch a movie, and maybe your parents have mounted one on the dashboard of their car to hold a phone being used for GPS navigation. But why buy one if you could build it yourself? In this project you\u2019ll use the engineering design process to design, test and build your own smartphone stand.\n---\n",

Conclusions Many and varied constraints have been identified that 3D printing with drones introduces, which are very far from those traditionally seen in structural engineering. As such, a new framework for their design and construction needs to be developed, at the interface between robotics, design visualization, materials science and civil engineering. The Peridynamic framework is very flexible and highly suited to modelling the 3D printing of buildings [...] dominant, load case \u2013 which is almost always self-weight. In addition it is difficult to achieve reliable tensile properties in 3D printed material and the lack of self-weight makes it difficult to use weight to pre-stress structures in compression as is traditionally done with masonry vaults. Since the Aerial-ABM drones have limitations on the amount of construction material they can carry per flight, options currently being investigated are to print using either a lightweight composite [...] are of course some limitations that the project will need to address (Latteur et. al. [8]), not least the need to minimize weight, increase positional accuracy, and to allow for refueling of drones, both in terms of their electrical power and their print material. The hardware design [6] and materials development [4] for this project are already well underway and the focus of this paper is on the structural engineering challenges associated with Aerial-ABM, and especially how to approach the\n---\n\nTitle: Types of Drone Data Export Formats - Hammer Missions\nContent: .obj -  simple & interoperable data format that represents 3D geometry\n\n.fbx  - 3D model file format commonly used in Autodesk environments.\n\n.dxf - DXF is short for Drawing Interchange Format  used in AutoCAD\n\n.ply - PLY is a computer file format known as the Polygon File Format\n\nHow to create a 3D Textured Mesh?\n\nA 3D Textured Mesh can be created by exporting 3D models from drone mapping software such as Hammer Missions as .obj, .fbx or similar files [...] .xyz -  a very simple format for recording points in 3D space.\n\n.las -   a file format designed for the interchange and archiving of Lidar data.\n\nWe will talk more about these formats later in the article.\n\nHow to create Point Clouds?\n\nYou can easily create this data by exporting 3D data from a drone software platform such as  Hammer Missions. For more information please see the post below: Processing Drone 3D Models\n\nFormat #2. Textured Mesh (3D)\n\nWhat is a 3D Textured Mesh? [...] The correct format ensures that the end-client or stakeholder can readily use the data and that the data can be easily integrated with other software tools used in GIS and Engineering environments.\n\nCommon Drone Data | Export Formats\n\nBelow we will go through the different drone data export formats, what they are, and why they are useful.\n\nFormat #1.
