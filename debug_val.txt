Checking example:
--------------------------------------------------
Desired Object:   I want a cup
Example Object:  I want a take away coffee cup please
Decision:        Checking...

Prompt:Human: You are a 3D modeling expert. Your task is to determine if this example would be helpful for creating the requested 3D object.

User wants to create:  I want a cup

Retrieved example:
Description: I want a take away coffee cup please
Object type: take away

Consider:
1. Is this example about the same type of object? (e.g., a cup example for creating a cup)
2. Is this example about a variant of the same object? (e.g., a coffee cup example for creating a cup)
3. Does it have similar structural components that would be useful? (e.g., a mug example for creating a cup)

Answer with ONLY ONE WORD:
- 'useful' - if the example is about the same object type OR a variant OR has similar components
- 'unuseful' - if the example is completely unrelated with no useful components

Answer:
